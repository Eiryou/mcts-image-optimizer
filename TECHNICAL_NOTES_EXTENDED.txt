## Render/Proxy note: Unicode filenames & Streamlit uploads
Some hosting stacks can break Streamlit uploads when the filename contains non-ASCII characters
(e.g., Japanese screenshot names). A known workaround is pinning Tornado to a pre-6.5.0 version.

This repo pins:
- tornado<=6.4.2

If users still see upload errors, rename files to ASCII (e.g., `screenshot.png`) and retry.
